We hope to learn about how health, well-being, and sleep affect one another within employees of both the Oregon Army and Air National Guard. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a supervisor training addressing family-supportive supervisor behaviors and sleep leadership behaviors. The supervisor training is designed to increase the support that supervisors give to their employees around work and family, as well as sleep health. \\n\\nYour participation in the supervisor training will take about 1 to 1.5 hours. Upon completion of the training, we also ask supervisors to engage in behavioral self-tracking for about 2 weeks. \\n\\nPROCEDURES: \\nThis is a randomized study. Neither you nor the investigator can choose whether you get placed in the intervention group or the control group. Half of the subjects will be placed in the intervention group and half will be placed in the control group. Depending on group assignment, some participants will receive the training early in the study while others will receive the training later in the study.\\n\\nThe computer-based training is self-paced so the amount of time it takes can vary from person to person, but on average it takes about an hour and a half to complete. You will learn about the importance of supportive supervision and what behaviors are most helpful for employees. There is also information about how you can support healthy sleep behaviors in your employees. There are periodic quizzes, as well as a pre- and a post-test to assess learning, reactions, and experiences. We will also ask you to rate the training at the end. Upon completion of the training, we also ask you to engage in behavioral self-tracking for about 2 weeks.\\n\\nAlthough your command/leadership requires your participation in this training, we are asking your permission to use the data collected from this training and the behavioral self-tracking exercise in order to scientifically evaluate the training. No identifying information will be associated with your training data; it will be kept in the strictest confidence. You are not required to allow the use of your data for research purposes.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this study now or in the future, or you think you may have been injured or harmed by the study, contact our study staff at meshstudy@ohsu.edu <mailto:rainbird@ohsu.edu> or at (503) 494-3444 (Toll-free number: 1-844-851-9294).\\n\\nACCESS TO YOUR TEST RESULTS \\nThe results of your tests will not be made available to you because the research is still in an early phase and the reliability of the results is unknown.\\n\\nRISKS AND DISCOMFORTS: \\nThere are some potential risks to participating in the study: \\n·\\tThe study poses the unlikely, but potential risk of a breach in confidentiality. We have many systems in place to ensure this does not happen.\\n\\nBENEFITS:\\t\\nYou may or may not personally benefit from being in this study.  However, by serving as a subject, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.\\n\\nALTERNATIVES: \\nYou may choose not to be in this study.\\n\\nCONFIDENTIALITY:\\nWe will take steps to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy. Your privacy is important to us. \\n\\nWe are doing many things to protect you:\\n·\\tWe will keep your name and any other information needed for our study in a locked file cabinet inside our locked research office. We keep any data on our secure server. Only our certified research team will have access to your data.\\n·\\tWe use code numbers (not your name) in the data file so your name and your responses are not in the same file or location.\\n·\\tWhen we write or talk about what we learned in this study, we will leave things out that could identify someone. We only report numbers from groups of people.  \\n\\nWe will create and collect health information about you as described in the Purpose and Procedures sections of this form. Health information is private and is protected under federal law and Oregon law. By agreeing to be in this study, you are giving permission (also called authorization) for us to use your health information as described in this form. \\n\\nThe investigators and study staff at OHSU may use the information we collect in order to conduct and oversee this research study, and we will make sure personally identifiable information are kept separate from your data/responses.\\n\\nWe may release this information to others outside of OHSU who are involved in conducting or overseeing research, including: \\n·\\tThe Funder of this study, The Department of Defense, and the funder’s representatives\\n·\\tThe Office for Human Research Protections, a federal agency that oversees research involving humans\\n\\nThose listed above may also be permitted to review and copy your records.\\n\\nWe will not release information about you to others not listed above, unless required or permitted by law. We will not use your name or your identity for publication or publicity purposes, unless we have your special permission.\\n\\nUnder Oregon law, suspected child or elder abuse must be reported to appropriate authorities.\\n\\nWhen we send information outside of OHSU, it may no longer be protected under federal or Oregon law. In this case, your information could be used and re-released without your permission.\\n\\nWe may continue to use and disclose your information as described above indefinitely.\\n\\nCOMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT: \\nInformation about you or obtained from you in this research may be used for commercial purposes, such as making a discovery that could, in the future, be patented or licensed to a company, which could result in a possible financial benefit to that company, OHSU, and its researchers.

You will not have any property rights or ownership or financial interest in or arising from products or data that may result from your participation in this study. Further, you will have no responsibility or liability for any use that may be made of your information.\\n\\nCOSTS:\\nThere will be no cost to you or your insurance company to participate in this study.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIABILITY: \\nIf you believe you have been injured or harmed as a result of participating in this research and require treatment, contact our study staff at meshstudy@ohsu.edu or at (503) 494-3444 (Toll-free number: 1-844-851-9294).\\n\\nIf you are injured or harmed by the study procedures, you will be treated. OHSU and the Funder do not offer any financial compensation or payment for the cost of treatment if you are injured or harmed as a result of participating in this research. Therefore, any medical treatment you need may be billed to you or your insurance. However, you are not prevented from seeking to collect compensation for injury related to negligence on the part of those involved in the research.
